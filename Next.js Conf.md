  #### _Topic Discussed:_ About the usage of Next.js and that in six months its usage increased by 15%. It was also discussed that no matter what we produce (static or dynamic), Next.js is hybrid. This framework provides a real time feedback for the developer experience. Other topics mentioned here are Next.js 11 and Next.js Live - that have very fast privew while making changes. The big thing about the Next.js Live is the toolbar for live changes. All the changes and comments made from everyone involved are displayed on the live privew on the web. The interaction between the users is huge (fast and easy).

  > "Next. js Live works perfectly, even when offline, eliminating the need to run or operate remote virtual machines."

  #### _Topic Discussed:_ It was discussed how the user can deal with images (large files) and that there are components to make fast load on them. While coding, the user can set up image place which is blurred at first and afterwards it sharpens. For the developers to achieve something, the framework must work (rules and checks).

Also about the script component for optimum loading (before interactive, after interactive - tag manager, lazy on load) to make beautiful UX. Loading web fonts on Next.js - custom font automatically load, and very fast load on the font styles (Google fonts and Adobe fonts).

  #### This framework was the missing piece for making web to thrive.
