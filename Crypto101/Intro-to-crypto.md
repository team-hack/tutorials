## What's The Blockchain
A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Its contents are public, but they are encrypted by different types of hashing algorithms.

The blockchain serves as a database, such as an SQL database. The difference is that nobody is in charge of the Blockchain and no single party can make adjustments to the information that is stored on it.
