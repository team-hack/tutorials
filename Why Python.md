# Why Python?
>
There are a few topics these days that make people want to explore further and even attempt to change their careers. It’s a decision that could potentially change their whole life. The only thing they need to do is to be persistent in reading a lot and dedicating few hours on a daily basis on some quality subjects. The price they are expected to pay is to spend less time than usual on “useless” everyday social media apps. As cliché as it may sound – future You would be grateful.

If you are new into coding, or you just want to switch to some of the most required jobs currently, in the filed of Machine Learning or Data Science - Python is the beginning of the whole story. It is a widely used programming language with a simple syntax which allows the users to express concepts in fewer lines of code than some other languages. People who work with data analysis and want to switch from excel (and a lot of pivot tables) could chose to make the functions, calculations, visualizations - faster, easier, simpler and better through Python.

High level programming languages such as Python allow programmers to write programs that are similar to the natural English languages. And you will probably ask why Python? Because it’s a very interesting language with easy-to-read syntax. It can be used for free i.e. it’s an open sourced language that everyone can use. It works on different platforms such as Windows, Unix and Mac

# Who uses Python and why?
>
As we are now living in a digital world, this programming language is present in almost every aspect of everyday living. There are few examples:
>
* Weather forecast – which is actually ML, but the basis is Python. 
* Sales forecast - where the data is first analyzed and visualized through Python and afterwards forecast models are made through ML.
* Banks use Python - through data science they analyze the credit capability of their clients. 
* Insurance companies use it to predict risk – what is the probability that someone would cause a damage.
* Electricity consumption in energetics.
* Marketing – to predict some behavior pattern of the users.

# Cool story behind it

There is a really cool story behind the name of this programming language. Does [Monty Python’s Flying Circus](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python) sound familiar to you?

P.S. You better start now because your investment in knowledge will be fruitful and will evolve through the years - such as the Python’s logo:
